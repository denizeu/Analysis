# My Analysis Plan

### 1. My Plan
I plan to analyze by calculating sequence lengths, GC content and kmer composition of these genomes from Asia, South America and Africa. I would like to also compare kmer compositions between different geographical locations. I would like to see if the kmer compositions of CoV2 genomes from Africa and South America are more similar to each other than to those of Asia. From this analysis I would like to come to a conclusion about which geographic locations if any of the three have a more similar kmer composition than the other. Another sequence feature I'd like to analyze is how the kmer composition changed over time in each particular location. I want to determine whether later sequences have distinct kmer compositions in comparison to earlier recorded sequences. 

### 2. Functions
I plan to use the previously created functions: sequence(), gc_content(), kmercount(). These will provide data for the sequence lengths, gc content and kmer count of these sequences. These functions have already been previously generated. I will also create new functions. Kmertime() will be a function that divides kmer compositions into time periods. I might be able to do this by separating the sequences by time period first using a sorting function. (I will also use our previously created kmer functions and build on them). Then, from there I can specify which time period I am analyzing for each. The output will be kmer compositions for each time period. Either I will separate the time periods into blocks or I will just use each date that is recorded in the data. I will also make a function to divide the headers by geographic location in order to analyze the effects of time and location on kmer composition. I will split the locations as we did when searching: Africa, South America and Asia. Then I will divide these locations in order to calculate kmer composition for each location. I will then build on previous kmer functions to create a kmer counter for each location and insert it into a tuple. This would also be useful if I would like to do further analyses on it. Then I will find a way to create a function that shows how different compositions are based on a certain threshhold. 

### 3. Plotting
I intend to plot gc content, sequence length and kmer count by location. I will put these data onto a scatterplot with x being location and y being the respective analyzed data. With a scatterplot, patterns based on location will be clear. The scatterplots will bring clarity of how these factors differ and how spread out these differences are across different locations. Next, to determine whether there is a difference in kmer composition over time I would use a line graph with x being the time and y being the kmer composition of each. A line graph is ideal because it will show change over time. I will also make each line represent the different locations in order for more clarity and to differentiate changes between the locations (therefore there will be 3 separate lines: one per location). When determining whether there is a difference in kmer composition based on location, I might use a box plot. Therefore it is easy to separate Asia, South America and Africa and it also will show specific numerical differences. The mean and median will make clear how different the compositions really are between areas. I will also make tables for every thing I am analyzing to make numerical differences clear and to store data easy for the reader.
