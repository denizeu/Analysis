# Data Description

[Genome sequences link] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Nucleotide&VirusLineage_ss=SARS-CoV-2,%20taxid:2697049&Completeness_s=complete&QualNum_i=50&Region_s=Africa&Region_s=Asia&Region_s=South%20America) This is a link to the genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 from Africa, Asia and South America. It was accessed on July 11, 2021.

<!-- TODO: Add which compoenents you included in the sequence headers -->
<!-- eg location, species, etc... -->

After finding a link to these genomes, I downloaded it and inserted this data as a file into the data directory. I also created a file called ".gitignore" to make sure that git does not track the entire file and to keep from committing all of that data.
